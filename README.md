# Google Homepage project!
## Goal
Make a clone of the google homepage, in order to familiarize myself with the basics of html and css, how elements are placed on the page, and how they get styled and aligned. My reference is the active google homepage from 1/9/2021, rather than the cached 2019 version linked in the project.

## Review
Well, the html/css itself is a godawful mess. Getting better, but it's a process.

The big thing I'm missing is I can't figure out how to keep the searchbar's `box-shadow` activated when typing. After finishing, I glanced at a few other versions of the project, and at least one managed to do it, but it wasn't obvious to me why theirs worked so rather than waste time on minutiae I think I'll just be moving on.
