## TO-DO:
- ~~Proper footer elements~~
- ~~Embed google logo~~
- ~~Searchbar~~
- ~~Searchbar icons~~
- ~~"Google Search" & "I'm Feeling Lucky" buttons~~
- ~~Position logo/searchbar/buttons~~
- ~~Refine buttons~~
- ~~Footer logo for carbon neutrality~~
- ~~Searchbar container should have a default size, plus margin so it shrinks when the window gets < about 540px~~
- ~~Apps icon and user icon to header~~
- ~~Media query for when width < 811px: stack footer elements~~
- ~~Dropshadow on searchbar select/hover~~ (doesn't seem to be possible if the selected is a child of the influenced object, so currently only on hover)
- Media query for when screen height < about 537px: ANIMATE logo shrinking (...aand now I can't replicate...)
